It refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.\n\nAI can be categorized into two types: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a narrow task such as voice recognition, and General AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do. Most of the AI we interact with today, like virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), are examples of Narrow AI.\n\nMachine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, provides systems the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. Deep Learning, a further subset of ML, uses neural networks with several layers (hence the ‘deep’ in deep learning) for even more complex data interpretation.\n\nAI has a wide range of applications. In healthcare, AI can predict diseases and suggest treatments. In finance, it can be used for fraud detection and managing investments. In transportation, AI can power self-driving cars. In education, AI can personalize learning and predict student performance.\n\nHowever, AI also poses significant challenges. There are concerns about job automation and privacy. Ethical considerations are also paramount, as decisions made by AI systems can have profound implications on individuals and society.\n\nDespite these challenges, the future of AI looks promising. With advancements in technology and computing power, AI is poised to create significant advancements in various fields. As we continue to innovate and regulate, we can harness the power of AI to create a better future.\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-24T07:04:45.529072Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-24T07:04:45.529528Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-24T07:04:45.535588Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-24T07:04:45.529502Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-24T07:04:45.534711Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large-cnn')\nmodel = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large-cnn')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-24T07:05:04.684947Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-24T07:05:04.685320Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-24T07:05:14.411562Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-24T07:05:04.685293Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-24T07:05:14.410635Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"vocab.json:   0%|          | 0.00/899k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"0453fe82623b437ea17fff18a94d4cd9"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"merges.txt:   0%|          | 0.00/456k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"2fe8af79e6304271aa35dd481671ebbf"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"tokenizer.json:   0%|          | 0.00/1.36M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"3461012af9674597abd0cc28c9d20a8a"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/1.58k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"be5d03e5006f43719291390fde62a156"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"model.safetensors:   0%|          | 0.00/1.63G [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"6b69245b6c4c497eb579ecee5bb48374"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"generation_config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/363 [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"40002ae9bb1b4359888b1a2265f900c8"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def generate_abstractive_summary(text, max_length=150):\n    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(\"summarize: \" + text, return_tensors=\"pt\", max_length=1024, truncation=True)\n    summary_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=max_length, min_length=50, length_penalty=2.0, num_beams=4, early_stopping=True)\n    summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n    return summary","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-24T07:05:17.341364Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-24T07:05:17.342070Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-24T07:05:17.347932Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-24T07:05:17.342039Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-24T07:05:17.346847Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"summary = generate_abstractive_summary(text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-24T07:05:25.520175Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-24T07:05:25.520904Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-24T07:05:35.054210Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-24T07:05:25.520871Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-24T07:05:35.053211Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"word_count_original = len(text.split())\nword_count_summary = len(summary.split())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-24T07:05:35.055972Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-24T07:05:35.056536Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-24T07:05:35.060935Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-24T07:05:35.056500Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-24T07:05:35.059992Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Original Text Word Count:\", word_count_original)\nprint(\"Summary Word Count:\", word_count_summary)\nprint(\"Summary:\", summary)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-24T07:05:43.572990Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-24T07:05:43.573332Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-24T07:05:43.578560Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-24T07:05:43.573306Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-24T07:05:43.577616Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Original Text Word Count: 283\nSummary Word Count: 58\nSummary: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that has the potential to revolutionize various sectors of society.
